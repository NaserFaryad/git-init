# Git Important Notes

## Authentication

**Step 1: Check Repository URL**

First, ensure that the remote repository URL is correct. You can check this by running:

```
git remote -v
```

If the URL is incorrect, you can update it with:

```
git remote set-url origin <new-url>
```

**Step 2: Check Authentication**

If the repository URL is correct, ensure that your credentials are correctly configured. For repositories hosted on GitHub, you can use a personal access token (PAT) instead of a password.

1. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub:

- Go to [GitHub's token settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
- Click "Generate new token".
- Select the appropriate scopes (usually, *repo* is sufficient).
- Generate the token and copy it.

2. Configure Git to Use the Token:

You can use the token when prompted for a password or save it in your Git configuration.

```
git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/RUTILEA/fingerprint-segment-restore.git
```

Replace <your-username> with your GitHub username and <your-token> with the generated PAT.

## Merge (Default Strategy)

**Option 1:No-rebase**

This will create a merge commit to combine the histories.

```
git pull origin develop --no-rebase
```

The `--no-rebase` option in Git is used to explicitly specify that you do not want to rebase your local commits when performing a `git pull`. Instead, it uses the default merge strategy to reconcile the differences between your local branch and the remote branch.

*Merge vs. Rebase*

- *Merge (Default):* Combines the histories of the local and remote branches by creating a merge commit.
- *Rebase:* Reapplies your local commits on top of the fetched remote commits, resulting in a linear history.

*Using `--no-rebase`* 

When you use the `--no-rebase` option with git pull, you are telling Git to use the merge strategy instead of rebase. This means that Git will create a new merge commit that incorporates the changes from the remote branch into your local branch.

*Example:* Suppose your commit history looks like this before pulling:

```
A---B---C (origin/develop)
     \
      D---E---F (local develop)
```

If you run `git pull origin develop --no-rebase`, Git will merge the remote changes into your local branch, resulting in a history that includes a merge commit:

```
A---B---C (origin/develop)
     \   \
      D---E---F---M (local develop)
```

Here, `M` is the merge commit that combines the histories of the remote and local branches.

**Option 2: Rebase**

This will rebase your local commits on top of the remote commits.

```
git pull origin develop --rebase
```

The `--rebase` option in Git is used to reapply your local commits on top of the upstream changes fetched from the remote repository. This is an alternative to merging, and it can result in a cleaner, linear project history.

Hereâ€™s what happens when you use `--rebase`:

- *Fetch the latest changes from the remote branch:* Git first fetches the latest commits from the remote branch you specify.

- *Move your local commits to a temporary area:* Your local commits that are not yet in the remote branch are temporarily removed.

- *Apply the remote commits:* The new commits from the remote branch are applied to your local branch.

- *Reapply your local commits:* Your local commits are then reapplied on top of the newly fetched remote commits.

*Example:* Suppose your commit history looks like this:

```
A---B---C (origin/develop)
     \
      D---E---F (local develop)
```

If you run git pull origin develop --rebase, Git will rebase your local commits D, E, and F on top of the updated origin/develop:

```
A---B---C---D'---E'---F' (local develop)
```

**Option 3: Fast-Forward Only**

This will only update your branch if it can be "fast-forwarded" without creating new commits.

```
git pull origin develop --ff-only
```
