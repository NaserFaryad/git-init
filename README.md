# Git Important Notes

**Step 1: Check Repository URL**

First, ensure that the remote repository URL is correct. You can check this by running:

```
git remote -v
```

If the URL is incorrect, you can update it with:

```
git remote set-url origin <new-url>
```

**Step 2: Check Authentication**

If the repository URL is correct, ensure that your credentials are correctly configured. For repositories hosted on GitHub, you can use a personal access token (PAT) instead of a password.

1. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub:

- Go to (GitHub's token settings)[https://github.com/settings/tokens].
- Click "Generate new token".
- Select the appropriate scopes (usually, *repo* is sufficient).
- Generate the token and copy it.

2. Configure Git to Use the Token:

You can use the token when prompted for a password or save it in your Git configuration.

```
git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/RUTILEA/fingerprint-segment-restore.git
```

Replace <your-username> with your GitHub username and <your-token> with the generated PAT.
